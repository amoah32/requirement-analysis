Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This repository explores the concepts, importance, key activities, and techniques used in requirement analysis. It serves as a guide for understanding how requirements are gathered, documented, validated, and translated into functional software solutions.

üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
It ensures that developers and clients have a shared understanding of what the system should achieve.

Importance in SDLC

Acts as a foundation for design and development.

Helps prevent misunderstandings and rework.

Ensures the final product aligns with user needs.

üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarity and Understanding: Helps all stakeholders agree on project objectives and scope.

Prevents Costly Errors: Identifying issues early reduces redesign and development costs.

Improves Project Success: Well-defined requirements lead to better design, faster development, and higher client satisfaction.

üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering: Collecting initial information from stakeholders.

Requirement Elicitation: Engaging users to extract precise needs.

Requirement Documentation: Recording requirements in structured formats like SRS.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Evaluating and structuring requirements logically.

Requirement Validation: Verifying accuracy, completeness, and feasibility.

‚öôÔ∏è Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements

Define what the system should do.
Example (Booking System):

Users can view available rooms.

Users can make, cancel, or modify bookings.

Non-Functional Requirements

Define how the system should perform.
Example (Booking System):

The system should load pages within 2 seconds.

The platform must handle 500 concurrent users.

üßæ Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams represent the functional interactions between users (actors) and the system.

Benefits:

Simplifies system functionality visualization.

Helps identify system boundaries and user interactions.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a system feature must meet to be accepted.

Importance

Clarifies when a requirement is complete.

Aligns expectations between stakeholders and developers.

Example (Checkout Feature):

Users can review their booking details.

Users can enter and save payment information securely.

A confirmation email is sent after successful checkout.
