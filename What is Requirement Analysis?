Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for designing, developing, and delivering a successful software product.

During this phase, software engineers and analysts work closely with clients and users to understand what the system should accomplish. The focus is on transforming business needs into clear, actionable, and measurable requirements.
