Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the project is built on a strong foundation of clear, agreed-upon needs and expectations between clients, users, and developers.

ðŸ”‘ Key Reasons Why Requirement Analysis Is Important

Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
Clearly defining requirements ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should do, preventing confusion, missed expectations, and costly changes later in development.

Improves Project Planning and Estimation
Well-documented requirements make it easier to estimate time, resources, and costs accurately â€” helping teams plan efficiently and meet deadlines.

Enhances Software Quality and User Satisfaction
By aligning development goals with user needs, Requirement Analysis helps create software that is both functional and user-friendly, leading to higher satisfaction and fewer post-release issues.
